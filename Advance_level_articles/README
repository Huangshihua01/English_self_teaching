*Hi Papa and Mama, this is the file you should read first before trying to decipher any pdf files shown in this folder.

*I have always been told, that INTEREST is the mother of success when it comes to learning a foreign language. I hope when you read the titles of these articles, at least one or two of them could catch your eyes. If so, please give them a try. 

*These are native-speaker level articles. I would recommend using whatever tools you have to understand the content of these articles. Google translation might be a good way to get the ball rolling, but it is always better to have your own understanding.

*It is Okay to start slow at the beginning. If you are able to finish reading any one of them at the end of September, I would say it is a HUGE success. So relax, pick one and start read it!
